Hi! I am currently a postdoctoral researcher working with [Krystal Guo](https://krystalguo.com) at the University of Amsterdam, funded by the [DAAD–German Academic Exchange Service](https://www.daad.de/en/). Previously, I was a substitute professor for Geometry at Otto von Guericke University Magdeburg. Before that, I was a postdoctoral researcher in discrete mathematics at Paderborn University, where I was part of the collaborative research center [Integral Structures in Geometry and Representation Theory](https://trr358.math.uni-bielefeld.de/Pages/aboutUs), funded by the [DFG—German Research Foundation](https://www.dfg.de/en/index.jsp).
I earned my doctorate from Paderborn University under the supervision of [Kai-Uwe Schmidt](https://math.uni-paderborn.de/en/ag/dm/?cHash=49e3a4ac0c474af67ece490d7b6d9ec4).

I obtained my bachelor’s and master’s degree in Mathematics (both with a minor in Physics) at Otto von Guericke University Magdeburg, Germany. During my master's studies, I was an exchange student at NTNU Trondheim, Norway.

My research focuses on combinatorics, particularly on combinatorial problems related to design theory, coding theory, and finite geometry. I am especially interested in codes and designs as subsets of association schemes, and I like to use methods from optimization theory to address questions arising in combinatorics and related fields such as finite geometry.

Furthermore, I am passionate about promoting inclusivity and diversity in the academic community.
