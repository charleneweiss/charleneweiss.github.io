Hi, I am a postdoctoral researcher in mathematics at Paderborn University in the group 'discrete mathematics' of [Kai-Uwe Schmidt](https://math.uni-paderborn.de/en/ag/dm). 
I earned my doctorate from Paderborn University under the supervision of Kai-Uwe Schmidt. 
Previously, I obtained my bachelor’s and master’s degree in Mathematics (both with a minor in Physics) at Otto von Guericke University Magdeburg, Germany. 
During my master's studies, I was an exchange student at NTNU Trondheim, Norway.

My main research interest is algebraic combinatorics. 
In particular, I study problems connected to coding theory, design theory, and finite geometry. 
I am especially interested in codes and designs as subsets of association schemes and using methods from optimization theory and algebraic graph theory to solve questions arising in combinatorics. 

Further, I am passionate about promoting inclusivity and diversity in the academic community.
