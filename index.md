Hi! I am currently a substitute professor for Geometry at Otto von Guericke University Magdeburg. Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher in discrete mathematics at Paderborn University, working in the collaborative research center [Integral Structures in Geometry and Representation Theory](https://trr358.math.uni-bielefeld.de/Pages/aboutUs) funded by the [DFG](https://www.dfg.de/en/index.jsp) (German Research Foundation).
I earned my doctorate from Paderborn University under the supervision of [Kai-Uwe Schmidt](https://math.uni-paderborn.de/en/ag/dm/?cHash=49e3a4ac0c474af67ece490d7b6d9ec4).

I obtained my bachelor’s and master’s degree in Mathematics (both with a minor in Physics) at Otto von Guericke University Magdeburg, Germany. 
During my master's studies, I was an exchange student at NTNU Trondheim, Norway.

My main research lies within algebraic combinatorics. 
In particular, I study problems connected to coding theory and design theory.
I am especially interested in codes and designs as subsets of association schemes and using methods from optimization theory to solve questions arising in combinatorics and related fields such as finite geometry.

Furthermore, I am passionate about promoting inclusivity and diversity in the academic community.
