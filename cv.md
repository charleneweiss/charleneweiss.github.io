From February 2023 to September 2024, I was the [equal opportunities officer](https://www.eim.uni-paderborn.de/en/faculty/faculty/organisation/equal-opportunities-officer) of the Faculty of Computer Science, Electrical Engineering and Mathematics at Paderborn University. 

From 10/2020 til 09/2022, I organized the [Lernzentrum Mathematik](https://math.uni-paderborn.de/studium/lernzentrum-unterstuetzung-im-mathe-studium) together with [Lara Gildehaus](https://www.uni-paderborn.de/en/person/78771), which is a learning center that employs student assistants and offers support to mathematics students and preservice higher secondary teachers of mathematics.
 
From 03/2018 til 09/2020, I was part of the team for public relations at the Institute of Mathematics, which organizes an open house to advertise mathematics and gives talks to high school students interested in studying mathematics. 
Moreover, I have been a mentor in the program [perspEktIve M](https://www.eim.uni-paderborn.de/en/faculty/studies/mentoring-program), which addresses female students at our faculty who are interested in research and doctoral studies.
 
I also was a member in hiring committees for professors and in the student-assitants-committee of the Institute of Mathematics.
