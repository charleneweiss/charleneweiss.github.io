At Paderborn University, I was a teaching assistant for several courses (all taught in German), see below. 

In 2020, the Faculty of Electronic Engineering, Computer Science and Mathematics of Paderborn University awarded me the [Weierstraß-Prize for excellent teaching](https://www.eim.uni-paderborn.de/en/faculty/studies/weierstrass-prize/weierstrass-prize-2020).
