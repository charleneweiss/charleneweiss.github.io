# Hi, I'm Charlene Weiß, PhD Student in Mathematics at Paderborn University. 

My main research interest is Algebraic Combinatorics. In particular, I study problems connected to coding theory and finite geometry. I am especially interested in codes and designs as subsets of association schemes and using method from linear and semidefinite programming to solve questions arising in combinatorics. 

Further, I am passionate about promoting inclusivity and diversity in the academic community.

I obtained my bachelor’s and master’s degree in Mathematics (both with a minor in Physics) at Otto von Guericke University Magdeburg, Germany. During my master's studies, I was an exchange student at NTNU Trondheim, Norway.
