Association schemes are central objects in algebraic combinatorics, with the classical schemes lying at their core. These classical association schemes essentially consist of the Hamming and Johnson schemes, and their $q$-analogs: bilinear forms scheme, alternating bilinear forms scheme, Hermitian forms scheme, $q$-Johnson scheme, and polar space schemes. Each of them gives rise to a distance-regular graph on a vertex set $X$, naturally endowed with the path metric. We study $d$-codes in these schemes, that is, subsets $Y$ of $X$ in which every pair of distinct elements has path distance at least $d$. A powerful tool for deriving upper bounds on the size of $d$-codes is the linear programming method. In the case of the Hamming and Johnson schemes, the linear program has been studied since the 1970s, but its optimum is still unknown. We determine the optimum of the linear program for nearly all classical association schemes distinct from the Hamming and Johnson schemes. This is achieved by constructing feasible solutions to both the primal and dual linear programs whose objective values coincide. As a corollary, we obtain upper bounds on $t$-intersecting sets in classical association schemes, providing new proofs of several known results and, in particular, improving earlier bounds on $t$-intersecting sets of generators in polar spaces. These results can be viewed as analogs of the classical Erdős-Ko-Rado Theorem in extremal set theory. Our proofs draw on techniques from algebraic combinatorics and the duality theory of linear programming.

**Nontrivial $t$-designs in polar spaces exist for all $t$**\

A finite classical polar space of rank $n$ consists of the totally isotropic subspaces of a finite vector space over $\mathbb{F}_q$ equipped with a nondegenerate form such that $n$ is the maximal dimension of such a subspace. A $t$-$(n,k,\lambda)$ design in a finite classical polar space of rank $n$ is a collection $Y$ of totally isotropic $k$-spaces such that each totally isotropic $t$-space is contained in exactly $\lambda$ members of $Y$. Nontrivial examples are currently only known for $t\leq 2$. We show that $t$-$(n,k,\lambda)$ designs in polar spaces exist for all $t$ and $p$ provided that $k>\frac{21}{2}t$ and $n$ is sufficiently large enough. The proof is based on a probabilistic method by Kuperberg, Lovett, and Peled, and it is thus nonconstructive.

A finite classical polar space of rank $n$ consists of the totally isotropic subspaces of a finite vector space equipped with a nondegenerate form such that $n$ is the maximal dimension of such a subspace. A $t$-Steiner system in a finite classical polar space of rank $n$ is a collection $Y$ of totally isotropic $n$-spaces such that each totally isotropic $t$-space is contained in exactly one member of $Y$. Nontrivial examples are known only for $t=1$ and $t=n-1$. We give an almost complete classification of such $t$-Steiner systems, showing that such objects can only exist in some corner cases. This classification result arises from a more general result on packings in polar spaces.

We show that there exist ordered orthogonal arrays, whose sizes deviate from the Rao bound by a factor that is polynomial in the parameters of the ordered orthogonal array. The proof is nonconstructive and based on a probabilistic method due to Kuperberg, Lovett and Peled.

This report documents the program and the outcomes of Dagstuhl Seminar 23161 "Pushing the Limits of Computational Combinatorial Constructions". In this Dagstuhl Seminar, we focused on computational methods for challenging problems in combinatorial construction. This includes algorithms for construction of combinatorial objects with prescribed symmetry, for isomorph-free exhaustive generation, and for combinatorial search. Examples of specific algorithmic techniques are tactical decomposition, the Kramer-Mesner method, algebraic methods, graph isomorphism software, isomorph-free generation, clique-finding methods, heuristic search, SAT solvers, and combinatorial optimization. There was an emphasis on problems involving graphs, designs and codes, also including topics in related fields such as finite geometry, graph decomposition, Hadamard matrices, Latin squares, and q-analogs of designs and codes.

Digital communications relies heavily on the usage of different types of codes. Prominent codes nowadays are rank-metric codes and subspace codes&mdash;the $q$-analogs of binary codes and binary codes with constant weight. All these codes can be viewed as subsets of classical association schemes. A central coding-theoretic problem is to derive upper bounds for the size of codes. This thesis investigates Delsarte's powerful linear program whose optimum is precisely such a bound for codes in association schemes. The linear programs for binary codes and binary constant-weight codes have been extensively studied since the 1970s, but their optimum is still unknown. We determine in a unified way the optimum of the linear program in several ordinary $q$-analogs as well as in their affine counterparts. In particular, bounds and constructions for codes in polar spaces are established, where the bounds are sharp up to a constant factor in many cases. Moreover, based on these results, an almost complete classification of Steiner systems in polar spaces is provided by showing that they could only exist in some corner cases.
